Consistency

I care about consistency within a given page and I care about consistency across an entire site. I believe that a consistent experience is easier for users to understand, thus creating a better user experience.

Clarity

When I talk of clarity, I mean of how easy is it for other developers (or future me) to understand the work I’ve done. Can a new team member ramp up quickly? Can a developer building out a new interface do so without stumbling their way through it or missing critical steps?

User Experience

Lastly, how will the user experience be affected by any of the above? For example, if I improve a widget experience for those using screen readers, I want to be able to easily roll out the change to that widget across the site.

How do I address performance in all the ways that it can affect the user experience? How does a consistent design affect the user experience? Is it worthwhile to replace native controls with custom ones?
